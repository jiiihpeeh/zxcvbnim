This is a zxcvbn clone  for Nim. It is based on a Python implementation.  

It does not support Decimal notation (and hence produces  a valid Json string). Decimal / bigInt score according to my understanding is a way to represent exact information. Zxcvbn(im) is a tool for *estimation* and only a magnitude should matter hence this is omitted for the shake of simplicity.
