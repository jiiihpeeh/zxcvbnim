This is a zxcvbn clone  for Nim. It is based on a Python implementation (https://github.com/dwolfhub/zxcvbn-python).  

It does not support Decimal notation (and hence produces  a valid json string). Decimal / bigInt score according to my understanding is a way to represent exact information. Zxcvbn(im) is a tool for *estimation* and only a magnitude should matter hence this is omitted for the sake of simplicity.
